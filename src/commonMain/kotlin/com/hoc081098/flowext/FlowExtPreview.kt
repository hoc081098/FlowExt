/**
 * Marks `FlowExt`-related API as a feature preview.
 *
 * FlowExt preview has **no** backward compatibility guarantees, including both binary and source compatibility.
 * Its API and semantics can and will be changed in next releases.
 *
 * Feature preview can be used to evaluate its real-world strengths and weaknesses, gather and provide feedback.
 * According to the feedback, `FlowExt` will be refined on its road to stabilization and promotion to a stable API.
 *
 * The best way to speed up preview feature promotion is providing the feedback on the feature.
