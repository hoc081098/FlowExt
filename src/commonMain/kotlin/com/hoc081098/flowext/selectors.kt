/**
 * Inspirited by [NgRx memoized selector](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/selectors).
 *
 * Selectors are pure functions used for obtaining slices of a Flow of state.
 * `FlowExt` provides a few helper functions for optimizing this selection.
 *
 * - Selectors can compute derived data, to store the minimal possible state.
 * - Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
 * - When using the [select] functions, it will keep track of the latest arguments in which your selector function was invoked.
 *   Because selectors are pure functions, the last result can be returned
 *   when the arguments match without re-invoking your selector function.
 *   This can provide performance benefits, particularly with selectors that perform expensive computation.
 *   This practice is known as memoization.
